# Business Site

Business site with a responsive video header, form with validation and different inputs as well as an accordion and navbar made with css and javascript.


## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
I had some issues with getting text and icons displayed on top of my video header but after looking at some videos I tried to use position: relative and z-index which made it work.
When looking at accordion solutions I saw that there were a lot of different approaches and I did not go after the one from our live session but instead found some material to read
that I thought was easier to get a grip of. Wanted to understand what my code does and not just copy paste a solution.
